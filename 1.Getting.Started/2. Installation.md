## 1. Download Go

### Depending on your operating system
        
> [Golang Website]( https://golang.org/dl/)

## 2. Installation ([relevant info](https://golang.org/doc/install))

* For [Windows 🖥] just run the `*.msi` file downloaded

    - Clicking `*.msi` file will install Go at `C:\go`

    - Make sure to add `C:\go\bin` to your PATH into your system env setup

    - This will also setup $GOPATH at `C:\Users\me\go`

    - Go to your system env setup and add `GOROOT` entry to be `C:\go`

    - Optionally in the system env setup you can change `GOPATH` to something else if you want

    - Open/Reopen Powershell and type `echo $env:GOROOT` to verify above steps

* For [Linux 🐧] extract the file and put the contents of the extract to a specific path in your machine

    Lets say you downloaded Go as **~/Downloads/go1.15.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz**

    1. Extract out in the **/usr/local** directory
    
        ```sh
        tar -xzvf ~/Downloads/go1.15.3.linux-amd64.tar.g -C /usr/local
        ```
    
    2. Put /usr/local/bin/go in your `$PATH`

        ```sh
        vim ~/.profile

        echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.profile

        source ~/.profile
        ```

    3. Test Go in installed

        ```sh
        go version

        go --help
        ```
    
## 3. Setup `$GOPATH` environment (path to a directory on your machine that Go will need)

`$GOPATH` is an environment variable that you need to set in your machine

`$GOPATH` is path to a directory in your file system where your project and third party projects will live

✨ You must have `$GOPATH` defined ✨

    Ex: 

    [🖥] C:\Users\me\go

    [🐧] ~/go

* [🐧]

    ```sh
    echo 'export GOPATH=~/go' >> ~/.profile

    source ~/.profile

    echo $GOPATH
    ```

* [🖥]: 
    
    ### For windows it already set when you install Go
    ### However you can change it by going to system environment setup page



## 4. Setup `$GOROOT` environment (path to go installation)

* [🐧]

     ```sh
     echo 'export GOROOT=/usr/local/go' >> ~/.profile
     
     source ~/.profile
     
     echo $GOROOT
     ```
* [🖥]: 
    
    ### Follow `$GOPATH env` instruction above

## 5. [📁] Directory structure

```
$GOPATH
   └─ src
      └─ yourName
         └─ yourProject
	  └─ github.com
	     └─ gorilla
	        └─ mux
	  └─ github.com
	     └─ yourHandle
	        └─ yourProject
   └─ pkg (contains compiled code when NOT using go modules)
      └─ linux_amd ([🐧] architecture specific)
      └─ windows_amd ([🖥] architecture specific)
      └─ mod (Similar to 'src' but used by Go when $GO111MODULE=on)
   └─ bin (`go install` command will use this location to put compiled binaries)
```
