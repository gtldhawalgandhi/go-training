## What is Golang (Go)❓

Go is a type safe, compile type programming language created by Google (and also contributed by people from around the world) and launched in 2009, and is an attempt combine the ease of programming of an interpreted dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed compiled language.


Go is boring..And That’s Fantastic!

It was built to create modern applications.

What is Modern?
- Multi core CPUs
- Concurrent programming
- Most languages were created before time when multi core was not a concept

## Unique features of Go?
1. Type safety
2. Fast build times
3. Write concurrent code much easily
4. Easy to learn (low specification footprint)
5. Compiles to native binary
6. Fast runtime
7. Uses less resourses (hence cost effective)
8. Writing cross platform code is very easy
9. Writing CLI apps is very easy

## Why Go❓
1. Some big softwares in the industry are written in Go
    * Docker
    * Kubernetes
    * CoreOS
    * CockroachDB
    * Prometheus
    * many more...
2. Big companies who use Go
    * Google
    * [Uber](https://github.com/uber?q=&type=source&language=go)
    * [AWS](https://github.com/aws/?q=&type=source&language=go)
    * [Digitalocean](https://github.com/digitalocean?q=&type=source&language=go)
    * [Soudcloud](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
    * [Dropbox](https://github.com/dropbox/godropbox)
    * many more...
4. Make Software Engineering easy not clever
   - Maintainable code
   - Reliable code
   - Easy to read
   - Go back and read into the past

    A language that doesn’t have everything is actually easier to program in than some that do.
